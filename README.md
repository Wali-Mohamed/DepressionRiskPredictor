# Depression Risk Prediction Project

![Alt text](/images/depressionimage.jpeg)

## Problem Statement

Depression is a common but serious mood disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early identification of individuals at risk can lead to timely interventions, potentially mitigating severe outcomes. Traditionally, assessing depression risk involves clinical evaluations, which may not be accessible to everyone due to various barriers such as cost, stigma, and availability of mental health professionals.

This project aims to develop a predictive model that can identify adults at risk of depression based on survey data collected from a broad demographic. The survey includes a range of factors such as age, gender, job satisfaction, study/work hours, and family health history, which are non-clinical but have been shown to correlate with mental health risks.

The dataset used in this project is synthetic, generated from a deep learning model trained on an original survey dataset. The synthetic nature of the data ensures privacy and enables wide distribution for academic and research purposes without compromising individual data security.

## Solution Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the risk of depression ('Yes' or 'No'). The model will be trained on the synthetic dataset, with the option to augment this data with the original dataset to improve accuracy and robustness. This approach not only helps in understanding the impact of synthetic data on model performance but also explores how closely synthetic data can mimic real-world data in the context of mental health.

### Key Objectives:
- **Model Development**: Develop a robust machine learning model to predict depression risk.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the differences between the synthetic and original datasets to understand the limitations and capabilities of synthetic data.
- **Visualization**: Implement various data visualization techniques to uncover underlying patterns and insights in the data.

This project is intended for researchers and practitioners in mental health, data science communities interested in the applications of machine learning in public health, and potentially for policymakers looking to understand more about population health management.
